Think about the fact that at one point, someone actually congratulated you for going to the bathroom and finishing all your dinner. If girls that exhibit masculine tendencies are praised for their strength while boys that display more feminine interests are rejected, what are we teaching children about gender? At a young age, we are already showing children that traditionally feminine characteristics aren't valuable. Life can be scary. We learn that at an early age. You learn that the first time you think there is a monster in your closet I'm 19, and am in no way planning on having kids any time soon (so you can breathe a sigh of relief, Mom). But I'm excited to meet you kiddos one day. I'm also scared that I won't live up to your expectations or mine. I can, however, promise you these 10 things though, and for now, I think that's pretty good. Every day you tend to learn something new.

In a world rife with war, religious, racial, gender, sectarian, and political strife, when so many children lack safety, enough food, shelter, health care, and education and suffer unthinkable losses of parents to disease, violence, and war, I hope this New Year will bring adults closer to our common sense and moral responsibility for children's well being. The national holiday celebrating Dr. King's birthday is over, but I hope we will heed and act on his 1967 declaration and work to win the first victory right here at home in the biggest economy on earth and end the shame of 14.7 million children being the poorest Americans by ending child poverty now. The new Every Student Succeeds Act begins a new era, but it is one without needed federal accountability and with the hopes that states will fulfill their crucial responsibility to educate all their children fairly and prepare them for work and life. What a terrible irony that in this year of celebration of the Selma marches we are witnessing the resurgence of overt law enforcement brutality and injustice in Ferguson, Cleveland, New York City, and elsewhere, reminding us how far we still have to go. The continuing protests against unequal justice under the law by those enjoined to protect all of us and all of our children after the deaths of teenager Michael Brown, 12-year-old Tamir Rice, and others are a wake-up call about the deeply embedded systemic racism still alive in America. Each of us has a responsibility to root it out and stop it in its tracks."

If ever there were an impeachable offense, selling out national security for your business interests has to top the list. Norway, like the U.S., is currently facing a serious backlash against immigration. What is Elizabeth Warren up to? Elizabeth Warren's offhand remark in an interview with People magazine strongly suggested that the Massachusetts senator has revised her previous firm declarations of non-candidacy for president and is now deliberately leaving the door open a crack. Asked whether she was considering a run in 2016, Warren said disarmingly, \"I don't think so,\" but added, \"If there's any lesson I've learned in the last five years, it's don't be so sure about what lies ahead. There are amazing doors that could open.\" That sure opened one door. Is Warren really thinking about challenging frontrunner Hillary Clinton? I'd be surprised if Warren has made any decision on that question, but her remark immediately set off two kinds of political waves. When you consider what has been happening to the average working person since the era of Ronald Reagan, it's amazing that the Republicans have fought the Democrats about to a draw. The recipe of Reagan and both Bushes has been to weaken government, undermine the regulation of market excesses, attack core social insurance programs, tilt the tax system away from the wealthy and towards the middle class, gut the safeguards that protect workers on the job, make college ever more unaffordable, and appoint judges who undermine democracy itself. That stuff is not exactly popular. Yet Democrats seem largely unable to convert Republican elitism to their advantage."

Today congress is populated primarily (but not exclusively) by Lilliputians and demagogues, who have well earned their abysmal 6 percent approval rating. Americans now have yet another question to ponder. The U.S. has grossly violated international norms of civilized behavior. We have also broken our word.  Why should American's care? Appalled both by the concentrations of wealth enjoyed by the French aristocracy and by their callous exploitation of the poor, Thomas Jefferson proposed an antidote for the fledgling United States: a progressive tax code. At the root of the culture wars lies a fundamental dichotomy in worldviews. Which is more essential to humanity: the individual or the collective? A common public misperception is that tenure perpetuates mediocrity by permitting lifetime appointments for lackluster professors. In practice, the reverse is true: Tenure contributes to hiring the best and brightest."

It is a national disgrace that so many poor children live in the United States of America -- the world's richest economy. It doesn't have to be this way. It's costly. And it's the greatest threat to our future national, economic and military security. Congress must stop playing politics with children and pass four more years of funding for CHIP and MIECHV as part of the \"doc fix\" package if millions of children are not to be left with uncertainty and at greater risk. We need to ensure our children are healthy, supported, and strong if they are going to be able to support our growing number of seniors in the future. Nobody of any age should be held in jail without a trial for three years. No child or adolescent should be held in an adult jail. Yet, a 16-year-old accused of stealing a backpack was kept in one of the most violent adult jails in the United States, Rikers Island in New York City, for three years without a trial. This was morally scandalous and inhumane. Even worse, he spent more than two years of that time in solitary confinement, locked up alone except to go to the shower, the recreation area, the visit room or the medical clinic. This was torture. The suicide of 22-year-old Kalief Browder on June 6, barely two years after his release and return home, was the final horror in his tragic and brutal journey into the depths of the adult criminal justice system in New York."

To close the racial and economic achievement gaps, we must regain the confidence required to tackle out-of-school issues as well as in-school issues. Most innovations fail. And like NPR Planet Money's Adam Davidson explains, \"life span of innovations has never shorter, meaning that failure happens more quickly.\" So it is not too soon to start to contemplate of the obituaries of the contemporary school reform movement.

The continuing protests against unequal justice under the law by those enjoined to protect all of us and all of our children after the deaths of teenager Michael Brown, 12-year-old Tamir Rice, and others are a wake-up call about the deeply embedded systemic racism still alive in America. Each of us has a responsibility to root it out and stop it in its tracks. As a nation it's time to close our hypocrisy gap in the treatment of our children and value and protect our children -- all of them. We need to examine with urgency how we treat our children and the gap between what we say and what we do. Bryan Stevenson is unwavering in that vision and in lifting his voice of great moral clarity at the forefront of the struggle. Every new hard-earned and overdue victory should remind us all that we must keep moving towards greater justice for all. America is still struggling to live up to its creed enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and overcome its huge birth defects built into the implementation of our political and economic system.
